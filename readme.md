# Admin Refresh

Cleans up and personalises the admin interface making it more tailored for your website. Features include:

* Add your logo to the login screen
* Clean up the admin menu
* Relabel "Posts" to the less blog centric "Articles"
* Clean up the admin Dashboard widgets
* Custom branded footer text in the admin area

## Usage

Activate the plugin like you would any other. 

The only aspect that requires any customisation is setting up the admin logo. This is done by looking for an image called `admin-logo.png` in the root directory of your theme. This image should be **274px by 63px**. If this image doesn't exist, the login screen will display the default WordPress logo.
